                    One of my favor places to learn from is <Link href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/code-a-project-three-different-ways-javascript-rest-api-database/">FreeCodeCamp.org</Link>. I came across this amazing set of tutorials that did an excellent job in explaining how to build a project from start to finish using the MERN stack. The challenge was to build a Flight Widget that would show arrivals and departures much like what you would see in at an airport terminal.

                    Ania takes you through some interesting tools and examples of how to set up your environment. When it came to the database I chose to use mongodb Atlas. This was a bit of a challenge and I had to research quite a few articles to get it up and running with her tutorial. I found some great articles on DailyDev.org that helped tremendously.
